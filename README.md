# Gary Gregg Project Proposal

# R scripts
These include several R scripts used to produce a CSV file containing election results for the 2000 through 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.  The files are named add\_beta\_params.R, add\_state\_id.R, create\_input\_csv.R, create\_summary.R, experiments.R and insure\_totals.R.

# CSV files
The most important of these is used by the application, and is named vote\_totals.csv.  There is also intermediate files named aggregation.csv and state\_ids.csv.
